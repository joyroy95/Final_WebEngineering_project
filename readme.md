This document describes the project implementation for developing the university admission test.
The project implements PHP laravel. The project will be capable of running on standard internet
web browsers. The interface for the project will provide all the facility for the admission of the
admission in the university.


Implementation is the stage of the project when the theoretical design is turned out
into a working system. Thus it can be considered to be the most critical stage in achieving a
successful new system and in giving the user, confidence that the new system will work and be
effective. The implementation stage involves careful planning, investigation of the existing
system and itâ€™s constraints on implementation, designing of methods to achieve changeover and
evaluation of changeover methods.
